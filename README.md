# ArcaneDefence
The c++ files from my Arcane Defence game.

A small 3rd-person defence game. Where the player must hold off the attacking forces for 5 minutes.

I made an effort to break functionality down into components and inherited classes where reasonable. 


Note: A number of the c++ files have the "PorfolioProject" name. This was the initial placeholder name.
